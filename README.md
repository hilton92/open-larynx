This program is used to visualize the relative motion between the thyroid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilage of the larynx. The axis of rotation between the two can be adjusted by the user. The location in 3D space of the laryngeal prominence over the cycle of motion can be recorded and saved in a text file. All parts of the larynx can be grayed out to aid in visualization. The graphics library used is OpenSceneGraph.
